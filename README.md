## 1. Architecture Design:

User Management: This service will handle user registration, authentication, and manage user profiles.
Book Catalog: This service will maintain a catalog of books available in the store, containing details about each book.
Shopping Cart: This service will manage the shopping cart functionality, allowing users to add, remove, and update items in their cart.
Order Processing: This service will process orders, handling tasks like payment processing and order tracking.
Communication between Services

Services will communicate asynchronously using Amazon SNS and SQS, using a publish/subscribe model.

## 2. Technology Selection:

User Management: We could use Node.js for handling HTTP requests/responses. We would deploy the application on Elastic Beanstalk. Amazon Cognito would handle user management and authentication.
Book Catalog: We could use Node.js for creating the API. We would deploy the application on Elastic Beanstalk. The catalog would be stored in MongoDB due to its flexible schema which is suitable for a catalog with various types of data.
Shopping Cart: Node.js would be used here as well. We would deploy the application on Elastic Beanstalk. The shopping cart data can be stored in MongoDB due to its flexible schema.
Order Processing: Node.js can also handle this service. We would deploy the application on Elastic Beanstalk. We can use MongoDB for handling transactional data.
In all services, API Gateway would be used to expose the APIs and manage them.

## Handling Fault Tolerance and Resilience:

Microservices are designed to handle failures by isolating faults to the service where they occur. This means that even if a service fails, the others can continue to operate as usual. This is often termed as fault isolation. Docker containers encapsulate the microservices and their dependencies making them portable and predictable during execution.

Orchestrating these containers using Kubernetes takes fault tolerance and resilience to another level. Kubernetes has several built-in features for fault tolerance:

* Self-healing: Kubernetes automatically replaces and reschedules containers when they fail. It can also kill containers that don't respond to health checks based on the readiness and liveness probes you configure.

* Automated rollouts & rollbacks: Kubernetes progressively rolls out changes to your application ensuring that not all instances are worked on at the same time. If something goes wrong, Kubernetes can rollback the change for you.

* Horizontal scaling & load balancing: Kubernetes can scale up and down the application based on CPU usage or other application-specific metrics. It also distributes network traffic to ensure the deployment is stable.

## Data Storage:

Different types of data have different storage requirements. For structured data with relationships, PostgreSQL is a good choice. PostgreSQL offers ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which can ensure the data consistency over transactions.

For unstructured data or when you need a more flexible schema, MongoDB is a good choice. MongoDB stores data in a JSON-like format and can easily handle a variety of different types of data.

Both PostgreSQL and MongoDB can be configured for replication, providing a backup mechanism and increasing data availability. They can also be partitioned to distribute data across different nodes, improving write performance.

Caching with Redis can significantly improve read performance and reduce the load on the databases. It stores frequently accessed data in memory and can serve future requests for that data quickly. It can be used for session caching, full-page caching, and caching database queries in your application.

## Scalability:

Microservices are independently deployable services, so they can be scaled up and down based on their individual requirements. Kubernetes enables you to automate this scaling. If a service requires more resources, Kubernetes can start more instances of it (horizontal scaling).

Kubernetes also supports autoscaling based on CPU usage or custom metrics defined using Kubernetes Metrics Server. With autoscaling, Kubernetes can automatically adjust the number of service instances based on the demand.

For the databases, replication and sharding/partitioning techniques can be used to scale. Replication increases data availability and improves read performance, as read operations can be distributed across multiple nodes. Sharding or partitioning distributes data across different databases, which can improve write performance.

Remember, managing these scaling operations requires careful configuration to ensure that services can communicate efficiently, and that data consistency is maintained.

# Online Bookstore

The online bookstore application is a web-based platform built using React for frontend, and Node.js with Express.js for backend. This platform allows users to view a list of available books, add them to a shopping cart, and process orders.

## Version

0.1.0

## Installation

Before you start installation, make sure you have Node.js installed in your system.

You can download it here.

Once Node.js is installed, you can proceed with the following steps:

### Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/online-bookstore.git

### Install the dependencies
cd online-bookstore
npm install

### Usage
 
### Development
To start the application in development mode, run:

npm run dev

The application runs the webpack-dev-server and the backend server concurrently.

### Production
To create a production build, use:

npm run build

This will generate a production build of your frontend code.

To start the server, use:

npm start

The server is set to start at the entry point src/server/server.js.
